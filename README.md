# final-project_front-end

## Directory Structure

## Roadmap

The stretch goal that we're currently working on is to integrate the recipe arm of our product design. With this stretch goal, users should be able to locate and search for seasonal recipes which match up to different foods in season.

Potentially, we will create an intermediary API between our front and back-end which can help sort and tidy the recipes data we are pulling from various places. Regarding the front-end, some stretch goals we'd like to implement next include adding in seasonal colour scheme functionality and expanding our searchbar functionality.

Following meeting this stretch goal, our next goal will be to integrate a maps API, to allow users to search for local farms and growers near them.
