# Manifesto

## Values

- Psychological safety is key!
- We value our breaks and respect our working boundaries
- There are no bad ideas
- Everyone has a voice
- Never code alone
- We celebrate as a team
- We want team ownership in every aspect of our project
- We honour the process rather than rushing to the end

## How will we handle conflict

We have a few methods for handling conflict:

1. First we have a cooling off period, and change what we’re working on
2. Depending on the severity of the conflict we approach it in a few ways - if it’s a non-emotive problem then we flip a coin
3. If tensions are running high then we break the tension with a DANCE OFF
4. The aim is to de-escalate the situation if tensions get too high

## How will we make decisions

- We will use dot voting / roman voting and coin flips
- We will use Trello to keep track of tasks and allocate work

---

## How will we communicate

- We will use daily retrospective and stand-ups to ensure frequent communication
- We have a group Slack channel for check-ins and sharing resources
- We will have 3 day sprints of management - so for three days one person will be in charge of our meetings, note keeping and Trellos
- We will make descriptive commits
- We will leave clear comments in our code
- We won’t code without discussing it first
